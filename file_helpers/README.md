A collection of functions used to collect and organize files for batch jobs.

* file_helper_lib - a collection of functions for getting info on files, directories, or moving a file or directory.  
* glob_lib - a collection of functions for find files and directories using glob.
* pickle_lib - the core pickle functions so I don't have to look them up, just import them.
* text_helpers - colors for text in terminal output. Easier to scan when batching.
